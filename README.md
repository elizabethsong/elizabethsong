### 🤔 Who am I?
I'm a senior at Claremont McKenna College studying CS (at Harvey Mudd) and Economics. I'm interested in the intersection between social good, business, and tech. Previously, I interned at Fidelity Investments and researched equities; worked at Amazon in software engineering; built Products at [Foreign Affairs](http://www.foreignaffairs.com); and worked on [educational access](https://halogen.sg) for low-income students in Singapore. I'm fluent in many languages: English, Mandarin, Python, Java, Finance, and learning C/C++.
